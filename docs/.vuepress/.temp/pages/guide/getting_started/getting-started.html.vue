<p><em><strong>OMMR4all</strong></em> is a web application offering a workspace to manage the various steps of transcription medieval music manuscripts. These steps can involve manual or automatic processes and be applied to printed documents or handwritten ones. The application uses multiple algorithms, neural networks and post-processing steps. The project was developed at the chair of artificial intelligence and applied science of the University of Würzburg in the context of the Corpus Monodicum Project (<a href="https://corpus-monodicum.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corpus Monodicum</a>).</p>
<p>The goal of this documentation is to help interested users learning how to use the software.</p>
